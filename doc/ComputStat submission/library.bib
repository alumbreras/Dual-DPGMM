@article{Lathia2008,
abstract = {K-nearest neighbour (kNN) collaborative filtering (CF), the widely successful algorithm supporting recommender systems, attempts to relieve the problem of information overload by generating predicted ratings for items users have not expressed their opinions about; to do so, each predicted rating is computed based on ratings given by like-minded individuals. Like-mindedness, or similarity-based recommendation, is the cause of a variety of problems that plague recommender systems. An alternative view of the problem, based on trust, offers the potential to address many of the previous limiations in CF. In this work we present a varation of kNN, the trusted k-nearest recommenders (or kNR) algorithm, which allows users to learn who and how much to trust one another by evaluating the utility of the rating information they receive. This method redefines the way CF is performed, and while avoiding some of the pitfalls that similarity-based CF is prone to, outperforms the basic similarity-based methods in terms of prediction accuracy.},

abstract = {Network science is an interdisciplinary endeavor, with methods and applications drawn from across the natural, social, and information sciences. A prominent problem in network science is the algorithmic detection of tightly connected groups of nodes known as communities. We developed a generalized framework of network quality functions that allowed us to study the community structure of arbitrary multislice networks, which are combinations of individual networks coupled through links that connect each node in one network slice to itself in other slices. This framework allows studies of community structure in a general setting encompassing networks that evolve over time, have multiple types of links (multiplexity), and have multiple scales.},

@article{Milch2012,
abstract = {Tasks such as record linkage and multi-target tracking, which involve reconstructing the set of objects that underlie some observed data, are particularly challenging for probabilistic inference. Recent work has achieved efficient and accurate inference on such problems using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques with customized proposal distributions. Currently, implementing such a system requires coding MCMC state representations and acceptance probability calculations that are specific to a particular application. An alternative approach, which we pursue in this paper, is to use a general-purpose probabilistic modeling language (such as BLOG) and a generic Metropolis-Hastings MCMC algorithm that supports user-supplied proposal distributions. Our algorithm gains flexibility by using MCMC states that are only partial descriptions of possible worlds; we provide conditions under which MCMC over partial worlds yields correct answers to queries. We also show how to use a context-specific Bayes net to identify the factors in the acceptance probability that need to be computed for a given proposed move. Experimental results on a citation matching task show that our general-purpose MCMC engine compares favorably with an application-specific system.},

@article{Erosheva2004,
abstract = {PNAS is one of world's most cited multidisciplinary scientific journals. The PNAS official classification structure of subjects is reflected in topic labels submitted by the authors of articles, largely related to traditionally established disciplines. These include broad field classifications into physical sciences, biological sciences, social sciences, and further subtopic classifications within the fields. Focusing on biological sciences, we explore an internal soft-classification structure of articles based only on semantic decompositions of abstracts and bibliographies and compare it with the formal discipline classifications. Our model assumes that there is a fixed number of internal categories, each characterized by multinomial distributions over words (in abstracts) and references (in bibliographies). Soft classification for each article is based on proportions of the article's content coming from each category. We discuss the appropriateness of the model for the PNAS database as well as other features of the data relevant to soft classification.},

abstract = {In the context of Twitter, social capitalists are specific users trying to increase their number of followers and interactions by any means. These users are not healthy for the Twitter network since they flaw notions of influence and visibility. Indeed, it has recently been observed that they are real and active users that can help malicious users such as spammers gaining influence. Studying their behavior and understanding their position in Twitter is thus of important interest. A recent work provided an efficient way to detect social capitalists using two simple topological measures. Based on this detection method, we study how social capitalists are distributed over Twitter's friend-to-follower network. We are especially interested in analyzing how they are organized, and how their links spread across the network. Answering these questions allows to know whether the social capitalism methods increase the actual visibility on the service. To that aim, we study the position of social capitalists on Twitter w.r.t. the community structure of the network. We base our work on the concept of community role of a node, which describes its position in a network depending on its connectivity at the community level. The topological measures originally defined to characterize these roles consider only some aspects of community-related connectivity and rely on a set of empirically fixed thresholds. We first show the limitations of such measures and then extend and generalize them by considering new aspects of the community-related connectivity. Moreover, we use an unsupervised approach to distinguish the roles, in order to provide more flexibility relatively to the studied system. We then apply our method to the case of social capitalists and show that they are highly visible on Twitter, due to the specific roles they occupy.},

Moreover,$\backslash$nwe show that under mild technical conditions, clustering the objects$\backslash$non the basis of such a random subset performs almost as well as clustering$\backslash$nwith the full attribute set. We prove finite sample generalization$\backslash$ntheorems for this novel learning scheme that extends analogous results$\backslash$nfrom the supervised learning setting. We use our framework to analyze$\backslash$ngeneralization to unobserved features of two well-known clustering$\backslash$nalgorithms: k-means and the maximum likelihood multinomial mixture$\backslash$nmodel. The scheme is demonstrated for collaborative filtering of users$\backslash$nwith movie ratings as attributes and document clustering with words$\backslash$nas attributes.},

abstract = {Determining protein functions from genomic sequences is a central goal of bioinformatics. We present a method based on the assumption that proteins that function together in a pathway or structural complex are likely to evolve in a correlated fashion. During evolution, all such functionally linked proteins tend to be either preserved or eliminated in a new species. We describe this property of correlated evolution by characterizing each protein by its phylogenetic profile, a string that encodes the presence or absence of a protein in every known genome. We show that proteins having matching or similar profiles strongly tend to be functionally linked. This method of phylogenetic profiling allows us to predict the function of uncharacterized proteins.},

abstract = {Many real-world problems exhibit dual-heterogeneity. A single learning task might have features in multiple views (i.e., feature heterogeneity); multiple learning tasks might be related with each other through one or more shared views (i.e., task heterogeneity). Existing multi-task learning or multi-view learning algorithms only capture one type of heterogeneity. In this paper, we introduce Multi-Task MultiView (M2TV) learning for such complicated learning problems with both feature heterogeneity and task heterogeneity. We propose a graph-based framework (GraM2) to take full advantage of the dual-heterogeneous nature. Our framework has a natural connection to Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS). Furthermore, we propose an iterative algorithm (IteM 2) for GraM 2 framework, and analyze its optimality, convergence and time complexity. Experimental results on various real data sets demonstrate its effectiveness. Copyright 2011 by the author(s)/owner(s).},

abstract = {Social networks are growing in number and size, with hundreds of millions of user accounts among them. One added benefit of these networks is that they allow users to encode more information about their relationships than just stating who they know. In this work, we are particularly interested in trust relationships, and how they can be used in designing interfaces. In this paper, we present FilmTrust, a website that uses trust in web-based social networks to create predictive movie recommendations. Using the FilmTrust system as a foundation, we show that these recommendations are more accurate than other techniques when the users opinions about a film are divergent from the average. We discuss this technique both as an application of social network analysis, as well as how it suggests other analyses that can be performed to help improve collaborative filtering algorithms of all types.},

abstract = {Uncovering community structure is a core challenge in social network analysis. This is a significant challenge for large networks where there is a single type of relation in the network (e.g. friend or knows). In practice there may be other types of relation, for instance demographic or geographic information, that also reveal network structure. Uncovering structure in such multi-relational networks presents a greater challenge due to the difficulty of integrating information from different, often discordant views. In this paper we describe a system for performing cluster analysis on heterogeneous multi-view data, and present an analysis of the research themes in a bibliographic literature network, based on the integration of both co-citation links and text similarity relationships between papers in the network.},

abstract = {Most learning algorithms operate in a clearly defined feature space and assume that all relevant structure can be found in this one, single space. For many local learning methods, especially the ones working on distance metrics (e.g. clustering algorithms) this poses a serious limitation. We discuss an algorithm that directly finds a set of cluster centers based on an analysis of the distribution of patterns in the local neighborhood of each potential cluster center through the use of so-called Neighborgrams. This type of cluster construction makes it feasible to find clusters in several feature spaces in parallel, effectively finding the optimal feature space for each cluster independently. We demonstrate how the algorithm works on an artificial data set and show its usefulness using a well-known benchmark data set.},

abstract = {Many real-world problems exhibit dual-heterogeneity. A single learning task might have features in multiple views (i.e., feature heterogeneity); multiple learning tasks might be related with each other through one or more shared views (i.e., task heterogeneity). Existing multi-task learning or multi-view learning algorithms only capture one type of heterogeneity. In this paper, we introduce Multi-Task MultiView (M2TV) learning for such complicated learning problems with both feature heterogeneity and task heterogeneity. We propose a graph-based framework (GraM2) to take full advantage of the dual-heterogeneous nature. Our framework has a natural connection to Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS). Furthermore, we propose an iterative algorithm (IteM 2) for GraM 2 framework, and analyze its optimality, convergence and time complexity. Experimental results on various real data sets demonstrate its effectiveness. Copyright 2011 by the author(s)/owner(s).},

This is a significant challenge for large networks where there is a single type of relation in the network (e.g. friend or knows). In practice there may be other types of relation, for instance demographic or geographic information, that also reveal network structure. Uncovering structure in such multi-relational networks presents a greater challenge due to the difficulty of integrating information from different, often discordant views. In this paper we describe a system for performing cluster analysis on heterogeneous multi-view data, and present an analysis of the research themes in a bibliographic literature network, based on the integration of both co-citation links and text similarity relationships between papers in the network.},

The technique is intended for situations where evaluation of the density is computationally expensive, in particular for applications of Gibbs sampling to Bayesian models with non-conjugacy. We apply the technique to a Gibbs sampling analysis of monoclonal antibody reactivity.},

However, the applicability of CF is limited due to the sparsity problem, which refers to a situation that transactional data are lacking or are insufficient. In an attempt to provide high-quality recommendations even when data are sparse, we propose a method for alleviating sparsity using trust inferences. Trust inferences are transitive associations between users in the context of an underlying social network and are valuable sources of additional information that help dealing with the sparsity and the cold-start problems. A trust computational model has been developed that permits to define the subjective notion of trust by applying confidence and uncertainty properties to network associations. We compare our method with the classic CF that does not consider any transitive associations. Our experimental results indicate that our method of trust inferences significantly improves the quality performance of the classic CF method.},

abstract = {Abstract. Multitask Learning is an approach to inductive transfer that improves generalization by using the domain information contained in the training signals of related tasks as an inductive bias. It does this by learning tasks in parallel while using a shared representation; what is learned for each task can help other tasks be learned better. This paper reviews prior work on MTL, presents new evidence that MTL in backprop nets discovers task relatedness without the need of supervisory signals, and presents new results for MTL with k-nearest neighbor and kernel regression. In this paper we demonstrate multitask learning in three domains. We explain how multitask learning works, and show that there are many opportunities for multitask learning in real domains. We present an algorithm and results for multitask learning with case-based methods like k-nearest neighbor and kernel regression, and sketch an algorithm for multitask learning in decision trees. Because multitask learning works, can be applied to many different kinds of domains, and can be used with different learning algorithms, we conjecture there will be many opportunities for its use on real-world problems.},

abstract = {We consider the problem of using a large unla- beled sample to boost performance of a learn- ing algorit,hrn when only a small set of labeled examples is available. In particular, we con- sider a problem setting motivated by the task of learning to classify web pages, in which the description of each example can be partitioned into two distinct views. For example, the de- scription of a web page can be partitioned into the words occurring on that page, and the words occurring in hyperlinks t,hat point to that page. We assume that either view of the example would be sufficient for learning if we had enough labeled data, but our goal is to use both views together to allow inexpensive unlabeled data to augment, a much smaller set of labeled ex- amples. Specifically, the presence of two dis- tinct views of each example suggests strategies in which two learning algorithms are trained separately on each view, and then each algo- rithm’s predictions on new unlabeled exam- ples are used to enlarge the training set of the other. Our goal in this paper is to provide a PAC-style analysis for this setting, and, more broadly, a PAC-style framework for the general problem of learning from both labeled and un- labeled data. We also provide empirical results on real web-page data indicating that this use of unlabeled examples can lead to significant improvement of hypotheses in practice. *This},

abstract = {In recent years, a great many methods of learning from multi-view data by considering the diversity of different views have been proposed. These views may be obtained from multiple sources or different feature subsets. In trying to organize and highlight similarities and differences between the variety of multi-view learning approaches, we review a number of representative multi-view learning algorithms in different areas and classify them into three groups: 1) co-training, 2) multiple kernel learning, and 3) subspace learning. Notably, co-training style algorithms train alternately to maximize the mutual agreement on two distinct views of the data; multiple kernel learning algorithms exploit kernels that naturally correspond to different views and combine kernels either linearly or non-linearly to improve learning performance; and subspace learning algorithms aim to obtain a latent subspace shared by multiple views by assuming that the input views are generated from this latent subspace. Though there is significant variance in the approaches to integrating multiple views to improve learning performance, they mainly exploit either the consensus principle or the complementary principle to ensure the success of multi-view learning. Since accessing multiple views is the fundament of multi-view learning, with the exception of study on learning a model from multiple views, it is also valuable to study how to construct multiple views and how to evaluate these views. Overall, by exploring the consistency and complementary properties of different views, multi-view learning is rendered more effective, more promising, and has better generalization ability than single-view learning.},

abstract = {In many clustering problems, we have access to multiple views of the data each of which could be individually used for clustering. Exploiting information from multiple views, one can hope to find a clustering that is more accurate than the ones obtained using the individual views. Often these different views admit same underlying clustering of the data, so we can approach this problem by looking for clusterings that are consistent across the views, i.e., corresponding data points in each view should have same cluster membership. We propose a spectral cluster- ing framework that achieves this goal by co-regularizing the clustering hypothe- ses, and propose two co-regularization schemes to accomplish this. Experimental comparisons with a number of baselines on two synthetic and three real-world datasets establish the efficacy of our proposed approaches.},

abstract = {Recent advances in statistical network analysis based on the family of exponential random graph (ERG) models have greatly improved our ability to conduct inference on dependence in large social networks (Snijders 2002, Pattison and Robins 2002, Handcock 2002, Handcock 2003, Snijders et al. 2006, Hunter et al. 2005, Goodreau et al. 2005, previous papers this issue). This paper applies advances in both model parameterizations and computational algorithms to an examination of the structure observed in an adolescent friendship network of 1,681 actors from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (AddHealth). ERG models of social network structure are fit using the R package statnet, and their adequacy assessed through comparison of model predictions with the observed data for higher-order network statistics.For this friendship network, the commonly used model of Markov dependence leads to the problems of degeneracy discussed by Handcock (2002, 2003). On the other hand, model parameterizations introduced by Snijders et al (2006) and Hunter and Handcock (2006) avoid degeneracy and provide reasonable fit to the data. Degree-only models did a poor job of capturing observed network structure; those that did best included terms both for heterogeneous mixing on exogenous attributes (grade and self-reported race) as well as endogenous clustering. Networks simulated from this model were largely consistent with the observed network on multiple higher-order network statistics, including the number of triangles, the size of the largest component, the overall reachability, the distribution of geodesic distances, the degree distribution, and the shared partner distribution. The ability to fit such models to large datasets and to make inference about the underling processes generating the network represents a major advance in the field of statistical network analysis.},

As the popularity of such message boards has increased, communities of users have emerged, and several prominent types of social role have been identified, such as Question Answerer, Celebrity, Discussion Person and Topic Initiator. Recent studies have noted the structural similarity of the egocentric network of users assigned the same role by qualitative criteria. In this paper a methodology is developed with which to cluster together users with similar ego-centric network structures. This is achieved using a mixed membership formulation which allows for the fact that different groups of users may have characteristics in common. The method is then applied to data taken from boards.ie, a medium sized message boards website. Prominent clusters of users are identified and discussed, and illustrative examples of user behaviour provided. The type of interaction, both locally and globally, taking place within forums is examined.},

abstract = {This paper introduces the problem of combining multiple partitionings of a set of objects into a single consolidated clustering without accessing the features or algorithms that determined these partitionings. We rst identify several application scenarios for the resultant `knowledge reuse' framework that we call cluster ensembles. The cluster ensemble problem is then formalized as a combinatorial optimization problem in terms of shared mutual information. In addition to a direct maximization approach, we propose three e ective and efficient techniques for obtaining high-quality combiners (consensus functions). The rst combiner induces a similarity measure from the partitionings and then reclusters the objects. The second combiner is based on hypergraph partitioning. The third one collapses groups of clusters into meta-clusters which then compete for each object to determine the combined clustering. Due to the low computational costs of our techniques, it is quite feasible to use a supra-consensus function that evaluates all three approaches against the objective function and picks the best solution for a given situation. We evaluate the effectiveness of cluster ensembles in three qualitatively di erent application scenarios: (i) where the original clusters were formed based on non-identical sets of features, (ii) where the original clustering algorithms worked on non-identical sets of objects, and (iii) where a common data-set is used and the main purpose of combining multiple clusterings is to improve the quality and robustness of the solution. Promising results are obtained in all three situations for synthetic as well as real data-sets.},

First, we introduce a Web-relevance similarity measure and demonstrate its effectiveness. This measure extends the Web-kernel similarity function introduced by Sahami and Heilman (2006) by using relevance weighted inner-product of term occurrences rather than TFIDF. Second, we show that one can further improve the accuracy of similarity measures by using a machine learning approach. Our methods outperform other state-of-the-art methods in a general query suggestion task for multiple evaluation metrics.},

@article{Fortunato2010,
abstract = {The modern science of networks has brought significant advances to our understanding of complex systems. One of the most relevant features of graphs representing real systems is community structure, or clustering, i. e. the organization of vertices in clusters, with many edges joining vertices of the same cluster and comparatively few edges joining vertices of different clusters. Such clusters, or communities, can be considered as fairly independent compartments of a graph, playing a similar role like, e. g., the tissues or the organs in the human body. Detecting communities is of great importance in sociology, biology and computer science, disciplines where systems are often represented as graphs. This problem is very hard and not yet satisfactorily solved, despite the huge effort of a large interdisciplinary community of scientists working on it over the past few years. We will attempt a thorough exposition of the topic, from the definition of the main elements of the problem, to the presentation of most methods developed, with a special focus on techniques designed by statistical physicists, from the discussion of crucial issues like the significance of clustering and how methods should be tested and compared against each other, to the description of applications to real networks.},

abstract = {SUMMARY: Motifs are small connected subnetworks that a network displays in significantly higher frequencies than would be expected for a random network. They have recently gathered much attention as a concept to uncover structural design principles of complex biological networks. FANMOD is a tool for fast network motif detection; it relies on recently developed algorithms to improve the efficiency of network motif detection by some orders of magnitude over existing tools. This facilitates the detection of larger motifs in bigger networks than previously possible. Additional benefits of FANMOD are the ability to analyze colored networks, a graphical user interface and the ability to export results to a variety of machine- and human-readable file formats including comma-separated values and HTML.},

abstract = {Cross-validated likelihood is investigated as a tool for automatically determining the appropriate number of components (given the data) in finite mixture modeling, particularly in the context of model-based probabilistic clustering. The conceptual framework for the cross-validation approach to model selection is straightforward in the sense that models are judged directly on their estimated out-of-sample predictive performance. The cross-validation approach, as well as penalized likelihood and McLachlan's bootstrap method, are applied to two data sets and the results from all three methods are in close agreement. The second data set involves a well-known clustering problem from the atmospheric science literature using historical records of upper atmosphere geopotential height in the Northern hemisphere. Cross-validated likelihood provides an interpretable and objective solution to the atmospheric clustering problem. The clusters found are in agreement with prior analyses of the same data based on non-probabilistic clustering techniques.},

abstract = {Measuring the similarity between documents and queries has been extensively studied in information retrieval. However, there are a growing number of tasks that require computing the similarity between two very short segments of text. These tasks include query reformulation, sponsored search, and image retrieval. Standard text similarity measures perform poorly on such tasks because of data sparseness and the lack of context. In this work, we study this problem from an information retrieval perspective, focusing on text representations and similarity measures. We examine a range of similarity measures, including purely lexical measures, stemming, and language modeling-based measures. We formally evaluate and analyze the methods on a query-query similarity task using 363,822 queries from a web search log. Our analysis provides insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each method, including important tradeoffs between effectiveness and efficiency.},

@article{Cheung2004,
abstract = {With the advent of the World Wide Web, providing just-in-time personalized product recommendations to customers now becomes possible. Collaborative recommender systems utilize correlation between customer preference ratings to identify "like-minded" customers and predict their product preference. One factor determining the success of the recommender systems is the prediction accuracy, which in many cases is limited by lacking adequate ratings (the sparsity problem). Recently, the use of latent class model (LCM) has been proposed to alleviate this problem. In this paper, we first study how the LCM can be extended to handle customers and products outside the training set. In addition, we propose the use of a pair of LCMs (called dual latent class model-DLCM), instead of a single LCM, to model customers' likes and dislikes separately for enhancing the prediction accuracy. Experimental results based on the EachMovie dataset show that DLCM outperforms both LCM and the conventional correlation-based method when the available ratings are sparse.},

abstract = {The aim of this paper is to understand the interrelations among relations within concrete social groups. Social structure is sought, not ideal types, although the latter are relevant to interrelations among relations. From a detailed social network, patterns of global relations can be extracted, within which classes of equivalently positioned individuals are delineated. The global patterns are derived algebraically through a 'functorial' mapping of the original pattern. Such a mapping (essentially a generalized homomorphism) allows systematically for concatenation of effects through the network. The notion of functorial mapping is of central importance in the 'theory of categories,' a branch of modem algebra with numerous applications to algebra, topology, logic. The paper contains analyses of two social networks, exemplifying this approach.},

abstract = {Both online and off, people frequently perform particular social roles. These roles organize behavior and give structure to positions in local networks. As more of social life becomes embedded in online systems, the concept of social role becomes increasingly valuable as a tool for simplifying patterns of action, recognizing distinct user types, and cultivating and managing communities. This paper standardizes the usage of the term 'social role' in online community as a combination of social psychological, social structural, and behavioral attributes. Beyond the conceptual definition, we describe measurement and analysis strategies for identifying social roles in online community. We demonstrate this process in two domains, Usenet and Wikipedia, identifying key social roles in each domain. We conclude with directions for future research, with a particular focus on the analysis of communities as role ecologies.},

And collaborative filtering techniques have proven to be an vital component of many such recommender systems as they facilitate the generation of high-quality recom-mendations by leveraging the preferences of communities of similar users. In this paper we suggest that the traditional emphasis on user similarity may be overstated. We argue that additional factors have an important role to play in guiding recommendation. Specifically we propose that the trustworthiness of users must be an important consideration. We present two computational models of trust and show how they can be readily incorporated into standard collaborative filtering frameworks in a variety of ways. We also show how these trust models can lead to improved predictive accuracy during recommendation.},

This article proposes several criteria which isolate speciflc aspects of the performance of a method, such as its retrieval of inherent structure, its sensitivity to resampling and the stability of its results in the light of new data. These criteria depend on a measure of similarity between two different clusterings of the same sei of data; the measure essentially considers how each pair of data points is assigned in each clustering.},

@article{Shi2008,
abstract = {Shi, Wang, Murray-Smith and Titterington (Biometrics 63:714-723, 2007) proposed a Gaussian process functional regression (GPFR) model to model functional response curves with a set of functional covariates. Two main problems are addressed by their method: modelling nonlinear and nonparametric regression relationship and modelling covariance structure and mean structure simultaneously. The method gives very good results for curve fitting and prediction but side-steps the problem of heterogeneity. In this paper we present a new method for modelling functional data with 'spatially' indexed data, i.e., the heterogeneity is dependent on factors such as region and individual patient's information. For data collected from different sources, we assume that the data corresponding to each curve (or batch) follows a Gaussian process functional regression model as a lower-level model, and introduce an allocation model for the latent indicator variables as a higher-level model. This higher-level model is dependent on the information related to each batch. This method takes advantage of both GPFR and mixture models and therefore improves the accuracy of predictions. The mixture model has also been used for curve clustering, but focusing on the problem of clustering functional relationships between response curve and covariates, i.e. the clustering is based on the surface shape of the functional response against the set of functional covariates. The model is examined on simulated data and real data.},

Here we present an approach to systematically study similarity in the local structure of networks, based on the significance profile (SP) of small subgraphs in the network compared to randomized networks. We find several superfamilies of previously unrelated networks with very similar SPs. One superfamily, including transcription networks of microorganisms, represents "rate-limited" information-processing networks strongly constrained by the response time of their components. A distinct superfamily includes protein signaling, developmental genetic networks, and neuronal wiring. Additional superfamilies include power grids, protein-structure networks and geometric networks, World Wide Web links and social networks, and word-adjacency networks from different languages.},

abstract = {This paper focuses on the application of factor analysis so as to identify consumer preferences for the protection of a Natural Area. We combine the use of factor analysis with the valuation data obtained by contingent valuation survey. The survey, conducted via in-person questionnaires in 1997, is targeted at the economic valuation of the protection benefits of the Parque Natural Alentejano e Costa Vicentina, a natural protected area along the southwest coastline of Portugal. Factor analysis results show that the consumer is characterized by a three-factor motivational structure: use, warm glow and non-use motivation factor, respectively. We introduce these motivation factors, together with the respondent's socio-economic characteristics, in the economic valuation function of such natural protected area. Estimation results show that consumer motivation factors have an econometrically robust role. Therefore, consumer motivations are interpreted as crucial information for accurate social cost-benefit analysis of alternative protection scenarios, and thus serve as an important cornerstone in designing an effective and broadly accepted management policy for the Parque Natural Alentejano e Costa Vicentina.},

Realizing the natural setting of social nodes associated with dual view information, i.e., The local node characteristics and the global network influence, we present a novel model that explores graph regularization techniques and integrates such information to achieve improved prediction performance. In particular, our prediction model is built upon the graph transductive learning framework that encodes an uncertainty regularization term in the conventional empirical risk minimization principle. Through taking advantage of the information from both the local profile and the global network characteristics, the final inference of the role or statues achieves minimum an empirical loss on the labeled set, as well as a minimum uncertainty on the unlabeled social nodes. We perform extensive empirical study using real-world data and compare with representative peer approaches. The experimental results on three real social network data sets show that the proposed model greatly outperforms a number of baseline models and is able to effectively infer in a wide range of scenarios.},

After a general introduction, CFA is differentiated from exploratory factor analysis (EFA), and the advantages of CFA techniques are discussed. Following a brief overview, the process of modeling will be discussed and illustrated with an example using data from a HIV risk behavior evaluation of homeless adults (Stein \& Nyamathi, 2000). Techniques for analysis of nonnormally distributed data as well as strategies for model modification are shown. The empirical example examines the structure of drug and alcohol use problem scales. Although these scales are not specific personality constructs, the concepts illustrated in this article directly correspond to those found when analyzing personality scales and inventories. Computer program syntax and output for the empirical example from a popular SEM program (EQS 6.1; Bentler, 2001) are included.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: The biologic significance of results obtained through cluster analyses of gene expression data generated in microarray experiments have been demonstrated in many studies. In this article we focus on the development of a clustering procedure based on the concept of Bayesian model-averaging and a precise statistical model of expression data. RESULTS: We developed a clustering procedure based on the Bayesian infinite mixture model and applied it to clustering gene expression profiles. Clusters of genes with similar expression patterns are identified from the posterior distribution of clusterings defined implicitly by the stochastic data-generation model. The posterior distribution of clusterings is estimated by a Gibbs sampler. We summarized the posterior distribution of clusterings by calculating posterior pairwise probabilities of co-expression and used the complete linkage principle to create clusters. This approach has several advantages over usual clustering procedures. The analysis allows for incorporation of a reasonable probabilistic model for generating data. The method does not require specifying the number of clusters and resulting optimal clustering is obtained by averaging over models with all possible numbers of clusters. Expression profiles that are not similar to any other profile are automatically detected, the method incorporates experimental replicates, and it can be extended to accommodate missing data. This approach represents a qualitative shift in the model-based cluster analysis of expression data because it allows for incorporation of uncertainties involved in the model selection in the final assessment of confidence in similarities of expression profiles. We also demonstrated the importance of incorporating the information on experimental variability into the clustering model.

abstract = {Bayesian approaches to preference learning using Gaussian Processes (GPs) are attractive due to their ability to explicitly model uncertainty in users' latent utility functions; unfortunately existing techniques have cubic time complexity in the number of users, which renders this approach intractable for collaborative preference learning over a large user base. Exploiting the observation that user populations often decompose into communities of shared preferences, we model user preferences as an infinite Dirichlet Process (DP) mixture of communities and learn (a) the expected number of preference communities represented in the data, (b) a GPbased preference model over items tailored to each community, and (c) the mixture weights representing each user's fraction of community membership. This results in a learning and inference process that scales linearly in the number of users rather than cubicly and additionally provides the ability to analyze individual community preferences and their associated members. We evaluate our approach on a variety of preference data sources including Amazon Mechanical Turk showing that our method is more scalable and as accurate as previous GP-based preference learning work.},

abstract = {The k-means clustering algorithm is one of the most widely used, effective, and best understood clustering methods. However, successful use of k-means requires a carefully chosen distance measure that reflects the properties of the clustering task. Since designing this distance measure by hand is often difficult, we provide methods for training k-means using supervised data. Given training data in the form of sets of items with their desired partitioning, we provide a structural SVM method that learns a distance measure so that k-means produces the desired clusterings 1. We propose two variants of the methods one based on a spectral relaxation and one based on the traditional k-means algorithm that are both computationally efficient. For each variant, we provide a theoretical characterization of its accuracy in solving the training problem. We also provide an empirical clustering quality and runtime analysis of these learning methods on varied high-dimensional datasets. 1.},

abstract = {Understanding social interaction within groups is key to analyzing online communities. Most current work focuses on structural properties: who talks to whom, and how such interactions form larger network structures. The interactions themselves, however, generally take place in the form of natural language --- either spoken or written --- and one could reasonably suppose that signals manifested in language might also provide information about roles, status, and other aspects of the group's dynamics. To date, however, finding such domain-independent language-based signals has been a challenge. Here, we show that in group discussions power differentials between participants are subtly revealed by how much one individual immediately echoes the linguistic style of the person they are responding to. Starting from this observation, we propose an analysis framework based on linguistic coordination that can be used to shed light on power relationships and that works consistently across multiple types of power --- including a more "static" form of power based on status differences, and a more "situational" form of power in which one individual experiences a type of dependence on another. Using this framework, we study how conversational behavior can reveal power relationships in two very different settings: discussions among Wikipedians and arguments before the U.S. Supreme Court.},

abstract = {This chapter describes a clustering procedure for microarray expression data based on a well-defined statistical model, specifically, a conjugate Dirichlet process mixture model. The clustering algorithm groups genes whose latent variables governing expression are equal, that is, genes belonging to the same mixture component. The model is fit with Markov chain Monte Carlo and the computational burden is eased by exploiting conjugacy. This chapter introduces a method to get a point estimate of the true clustering based on least-squares distances from the posterior probability that two genes are clustered. Unlike ad hoc clustering methods, the model provides measures of uncertainty about the clustering. Further, the model automatically estimates the number of clusters and quantifies uncertainty about this important parameter. The method is compared to other clustering methods in a simulation study. Finally, the method is demonstrated with actual microarray data.},

@article{Gorur2010,
abstract = {In the Bayesian mixture modeling framework it is possible to infer the necessary number of components to model the data and therefore it is unnecessary to explicitly restrict the number of components. Nonparametric mixture models
sidestep the problem of finding the "correct" number of mixture components by assuming infinitely many components. In this paper Dirichlet process mixture (DPM) models are cast as infinite mixture models and inference using Markov chain Monte Carlo is described. The specification of the priors on the model parameters is often guided by mathematical and practical convenience. The primary goal of this paper is to compare the choice of conjugate and non-conjugate base distributions on a particular class of DPM models which is widely used in applications, the Dirichlet process Gaussian mixture model (DPGMM). We compare computational efficiency and modeling performance of DPGMM defined using a conjugate and a conditionally conjugate base distribution. We show that better density models can result from using a wider class of priors with no or only a modest increase in computational effort.},

This family, labelled p*, generalizes the Markov random graphs of Frank and Strauss, which were further developed by them and others, building on Besag's ideas on estimation. These models were first used to model random variables embedded in lattices by Ising, and have been quite common in the study of spatial data. Here, they are applied to the statistical analysis of multigraphs, in general, and the analysis of multivariate social networks, in particular. In this paper, we show how to formulate models for multivariate social networks by considering a range of theoretical claims about social structure. We illustrate the models by developing structural models for several multivariate networks.},

abstract = {We present a new model based on Gaussian processes (GPs) for learning pairwise preferences expressed by multiple users. Our approach combines supervised GP learning of user preferences with unsupervised dimensionality reduction techniques for multi-user systems. The model not only exploits collaborative information from the shared structure in user behavior, but may also incorporate user features if they are available. We introduce the preference kernel which simplifies inference in this domain, allowing us to perform approximate inference using a combination of expectation propagation and variational Bayes. Finally, in real-world applications it is desirable to learn the model from minimal supervised data, for this purpose we present an efficient active learning strategy for querying preferences.The proposed model with active learning performs favorably on real-world data against state-of-the-art multi-user preference learning algorithms.},

abstract = {Abstract\~{}\~{}Given multiple prediction problems such as regression or classification, we are interested in a joint inference framework that can effectively share information between tasks to improve the prediction accuracy, especially when the number of training examples per problem is small. In this paper we propose a probabilistic framework which can support a set of latent variable models for different multi-task learning scenarios. We show that the framework is a generalization of standard learning methods for single prediction problems and it can effectively model the shared structure among different prediction tasks. Furthermore, we present efficient algorithms for the empirical Bayes method as well as point estimation. Our experiments on both simulated datasets and real world classification datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed models in two evaluation settings: a standard multi-task learning setting and a transfer learning setting.},

abstract = {A system of cluster analysis for genome-wide expression data from DNA microarray hybridization is described that uses standard statistical algorithms to arrange genes according to similarity in pattern of gene expression. The output is displayed graphically, conveying the clustering and the underlying expression data simultaneously in a form intuitive for biologists. We have found in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae that clustering gene expression data groups together efficiently genes of known similar function, and we find a similar tendency in human data. Thus patterns seen in genome-wide expression experiments can be interpreted as indications of the status of cellular processes. Also, coexpression of genes of known function with poorly characterized or novel genes may provide a simple means of gaining leads to the functions of many genes for which information is not available currently.},

abstract = {Discussion threads form a central part of the experience on many Web sites, including social networking sites such as Facebook and Google Plus and knowledge creation sites such as Wikipedia. To help users manage the challenge of allocating their attention among the discussions that are relevant to them, there has been a growing need for the algorithmic curation of on-line conversations — the development of automated methods to select a subset of discussions to present to a user. Here we consider two key sub-problems inherent in conversa- tional curation: length prediction—predicting the number of com- ments a discussion thread will receive—and the novel task of re- entry prediction—predicting whether a user who has participated in a thread will later contribute another comment to it. The first of these sub-problems arises in estimating how interesting a thread is, in the sense of generating a lot of conversation; the second can help determine whether users should be kept notified of the progress of a thread to which they have already contributed. We develop and evaluate a range of approaches for these tasks, based on an analy- sis of the network structure and arrival pattern among the partici- pants, as well as a novel dichotomy in the structure of long threads. We find that for both tasks, learning-based approaches using these sources of information yield improvements for all the performance metrics we used.},

Example applications of this multi-view setting include clustering of Web pages which have an intrinsic view (the pages themselves) and an extrinsic view (e.g., anchor texts of inbound hyperlinks); multi-view learning has so far been studied in the context of classification. We develop and study partitioning and agglomerative, hierarchical multi-view clustering algorithms for text data. We find empirically that the multi-view versions of k-means and EM greatly improve on their single-view counterparts. By contrast, we obtain negative results for agglomerative hierarchical multi-view clustering. Our analysis explains this surprising phenomenon.},

abstract = {In the Bayesian mixture modeling framework it is possible to infer the necessary number of components to model the data and therefore it is unnecessary to explicitly restrict the number of components. Nonparametric mixture models sidestep the problem of finding the "correct" number of mixture components by assuming infinitely many components. In this paper Dirichlet process mixture (DPM) models are cast as infinite mixture models and inference using Markov chain Monte Carlo is described. The specification of the priors on the model parameters is often guided by mathematical and practical convenience. The primary goal of this paper is to compare the choice of conjugate and non-conjugate base distributions on a particular class of DPM models which is widely used in applications, the Dirichlet process Gaussian mixture model (DPGMM). We compare computational efficiency and modeling performance of DPGMM defined using a conjugate and a conditionally conjugate base distribution. We show that better density models can result from using a wider class of priors with no or only a modest increase in computational effort.},

We consider the problem of inferring gene functional classifications from a heterogeneous data set consisting of DNA microarray expression measurements and phylogenetic profiles from whole-genome sequence comparisons. We demonstrate the application of the support vector machine (SVM) learning algorithm to this functional inference task. Our results suggest the importance of exploiting prior information about the heterogeneity of the data. In particular, we propose an SVM kernel function that is explicitly heterogeneous. In addition, we describe feature scaling methods for further exploiting prior knowledge of heterogeneity by giving each data type different weights.},

abstract = {The integration of usable and flexible analysis support in modelling environments is a key success factor in Model-Driven Development. In this paradigm, models are the core asset from which code is automatically generated, and thus ensuring model correctness is a fundamental quality control activity. For this purpose, a common approach is to transform the system models into formal semantic domains for verification. However, if the analysis results are not shown in a proper way to the end-user (e.g. in terms of the original language) they may become useless. In this paper we present a novel DSVL called BaVeL that facilitates the flexible annotation of verification results obtained in semantic domains to different formats, including the context of the original language. BaVeL is used in combination with a consistency framework, providing support for all steps in a verification process: acquisition of additional input data, transformation of the system models into semantic domains, verification, and flexible annotation of analysis results. The approach has been validated analytically by the cognitive dimensions framework, and empirically by its implementation and application to several DSVLs. Here we present a case study of a notation in the area of Digital Libraries, where the analysis is performed by transformations into Petri nets and a process algebra. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Holme2012,
abstract = {A great variety of systems in nature, society and technology -- from the web of sexual contacts to the Internet, from the nervous system to power grids -- can be modeled as graphs of vertices coupled by edges. The network structure, describing how the graph is wired, helps us understand, predict and optimize the behavior of dynamical systems. In many cases, however, the edges are not continuously active. As an example, in networks of communication via email, text messages, or phone calls, edges represent sequences of instantaneous or practically instantaneous contacts. In some cases, edges are active for non-negligible periods of time: e.g., the proximity patterns of inpatients at hospitals can be represented by a graph where an edge between two individuals is on throughout the time they are at the same ward. Like network topology, the temporal structure of edge activations can affect dynamics of systems interacting through the network, from disease contagion on the network of patients to information diffusion over an e-mail network. In this review, we present the emergent field of temporal networks, and discuss methods for analyzing topological and temporal structure and models for elucidating their relation to the behavior of dynamical systems. In the light of traditional network theory, one can see this framework as moving the information of when things happen from the dynamical system on the network, to the network itself. Since fundamental properties, such as the transitivity of edges, do not necessarily hold in temporal networks, many of these methods need to be quite different from those for static networks.},

In particular, models involving the alternating k-star, alternating k-triangle, and alternating k-twopath statistics of Snijders et al (2006) may be viewed as curved exponential family models. This article unifies recent material in the literature regarding curved exponential family models for networks in general and models involving these alternating statistics in particular. It also discusses the intuition behind rewriting the three alternating statistics in terms of the degree distribution and the recently introduced shared partner distributions. This intuition suggests a redefinition of the alternating k-star statistic. Finally, this article demonstrates the use of the statnet package in R for fitting models of this sort, comparing new results on an oft-studied network dataset with results found in the literature.},

abstract = {We introduce a method of functionally classifying genes by using gene expression data from DNA microarray hybridization experiments. The method is based on the theory of support vector machines (SVMs). SVMs are considered a supervised computer learning method because they exploit prior knowledge of gene function to identify unknown genes of similar function from expression data. SVMs avoid several problems associated with unsupervised clustering methods, such as hierarchical clustering and self-organizing maps. SVMs have many mathematical features that make them attractive for gene expression analysis, including their flexibility in choosing a similarity function, sparseness of solution when dealing with large data sets, the ability to handle large feature spaces, and the ability to identify outliers. We test several SVMs that use different similarity metrics, as well as some other supervised learning methods, and find that the SVMs best identify sets of genes with a common function using expression data. Finally, we use SVMs to predict functional roles for uncharacterized yeast ORFs based on their expression data.},

abstract = {Recommender Systems based on Collaborative Filtering suggest to users items they might like, such as movies, songs, scientific papers, or jokes. Based on the ratings Based on the ratings provided by users about items, they first find users similar to the users receiving the recommendations and then suggest to her items appreciated in past by those like-minded users. However, given the ratable items are many and the ratings provided by each users only a tiny fraction, the step of finding similar users often fails. We propose to replace this step with the use of a trust metric, an algorithm able to propagate trust over the trust network in order to find users that can be trusted by the active user. Items appreciated by these trustworthy users can then be recommended to the active user. An empirical evaluation on a large dataset crawled from Epinions.com shows that Recommender Systems that make use of trust information are the most effective in term of accuracy while preserving a good coverage. This is especially evident on users who provided few ratings, so that trust is able to alleviate the cold start problem and other weaknesses that beset Collaborative Filtering Recommender Systems.},

abstract = {We present a new probabilistic approach to modeling social interactions, that seamlessly integrates community discovery and role assignment for a deeper understanding of connectivity patterns in social networks. The devised approach is an unsupervised learning technique based on a Bayesian hierarchical model of social interactions. This model specifies an intuitive generative process, in which pairs of nodes in a social network are associated with communities as well as roles in the context of the respective communities, before that a directed interaction is possibly established between them. According to the generative semantics of the proposed model, nodes are represented as probability distributions over communities, while communities are represented as probability distributions over roles. Such distributions are unknown parameters of the proposed model, that are estimated from social-network data through approximated posterior inference and parameter estimation. A comparative evaluation over real-world social networks reveals that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art competitors in terms of link prediction.},

abstract = {The mean field methods, which entail approximating intractable probability distributions variationally with distributions from a tractable family, enjoy high efficiency, guaranteed convergence, and provide lower bounds on the true likelihood. But due to requirement for model-specific derivation of the optimization equations and unclear inference quality in various models, it is not widely used as a generic approximate inference algorithm. In this paper, we discuss a generalized mean field theory on variational approximation to a broad class of intractable distributions using a rich set of tractable distributions via constrained optimization over distribution spaces. We present a class of generalized mean field (GMF) algorithms for approximate inference in complex exponential family models, which entails limiting the optimization over the class of cluster-factorizable distributions. GMF is a generic method requiring no model-specific derivations. It factors a complex model into a set of disjoint variable clusters, and uses a set of canonical fix-point equations to iteratively update the cluster distributions, and converge to locally optimal cluster marginals that preserve the original dependency structure within each cluster, hence, fully decomposed the overall inference problem. We empirically analyzed the effect of different tractable family (clusters of different granularity) on inference quality, and compared GMF with BP on several canonical models. Possible extension to higher-order MF approximation is also discussed.},

@phdthesis{Golbeck,
abstract = {The proliferation of web-based social networks has lead to new innovations in social networking, particularly by allowing users to describe their relationships beyond a basic connection. In this dissertation, I look specifically at trust in web-based social networks, how it can be computed, and how it can be used in applications. I begin with a definition of trust and a description of several properties that affect how it is used in algorithms. This is complemented by a survey of web-based social networks to gain an understanding of their scope, the types of relationship information available, and the current state of trust. The computational problem of trust is to determine how much one person in the network should trust another person to whom they are not connected. I present two sets of algorithms for calculating these trust inferences: one for networks with binary trust ratings, and one for continuous ratings. For each rating scheme, the algorithms are built upon the defined notions of trust. Each is then analyzed theoretically and with respect to simulated and actual trust networks to determine how accurately they calculate the opinions of people in the system. I show that in both rating schemes the algorithms presented can be expected to be quite accurate. These calculations are then put to use in two applications. FilmTrust is a website that combines trust, social networks, and movie ratings and reviews. Trust is used to personalize the website for each user, displaying recommended movie ratings, and ordering reviews by relevance. I show that, in the case where the user's opinion is divergent from the average, the trust-based recommended ratings are more accurate than several other common collaborative filtering techniques. The second application is TrustMail, an email client that uses the trust rating of each sender as a score for the message. Users can then sort messages according to their trust value. I conclude with a description of other applications where trust inferences can be used, and how the lessons from this dissertation can be applied to infer information about relationships in other complex systems.},

@article{Gu2009,
abstract = {There are many clustering tasks which are closely related in the real world, e.g. clustering the Web pages of different universities. However, existing clustering approaches neglect the underlying relation and treat these clustering tasks either individually or simply together. In this paper, we will study a novel clustering paradigm, namely multi-task clustering, which performs multiple related clustering tasks together and utilizes the relation of these tasks to enhance the clustering performance. We aim to learn a subspace shared by all the tasks, through which the knowledge of the tasks can be transferred to each other. The objective of our approach consists of two parts: (1) Within-task clustering: clustering the data of each task in its input space individually; and (2) Cross-task clustering: simultaneous learning the shared subspace and clustering the data of all the tasks together. We will show that it can be solved by alternating minimization, and its convergence is theoretically guaranteed. Furthermore, we will show that given the labels of one task, our multi-task clustering method can be extended to transductive transfer classification (a.k.a. cross-domain classification, domain adaption). Experiments on several cross-domain text data sets demonstrate that the proposed multi-task clustering outperforms traditional single-task clustering methods greatly. And the transductive transfer classification method is comparable to or even better than several existing transductive transfer classification approaches.},

abstract = {Online forums are rich sources of information about user communication activity over time. Finding temporal patterns in online forum communication threads can advance our understanding of the dynamics of conversations. The main challenge of temporal analysis in this context is the complexity of forum data. There can be thousands of interacting users, who can be numerically described in many different ways. Moreover, user characteristics can evolve over time. We propose an approach that decouples temporal information about users into sequences of user events and inter-event times. We develop a new feature space to represent the event sequences as paths, and we model the distribution of the inter-event times. We study over 30,000 users across four Internet forums, and discover novel patterns in user communication. We find that users tend to exhibit consistency over time. Furthermore, in our feature space, we observe regions that represent unlikely user behaviors. Finally, we show how to derive a numerical representation for each forum, and we then use this representation to derive a novel clustering of multiple forums.},

abstract = {The growth of accelerated graduate entry nursing programs has challenged traditional approaches to teaching and learning. To date, limited research has been undertaken in the role of learning preferences, language proficiency and academic performance in accelerated programs. Sixty-two first year accelerated graduate entry nursing students, in a single cohort at a university in the western region of Sydney, Australia, were surveyed to assess their learning preference using the Visual, Aural, Read/write and Kinaesthetic (VARK) learning preference questionnaire, together with sociodemographic data, English language acculturation and perceived academic control. Six months following course commencement, the participant's grade point average (GPA) was studied as a measurement of academic performance. A 93\% response rate was achieved. The majority of students (62\%) reported preference for multiple approaches to learning with the kinaesthetic sensory mode a significant (p=0.009) predictor of academic performance. Students who spoke only English at home had higher mean scores across two of the four categories of VARK sensory modalities, visual and kinaesthetic compared to those who spoke non-English. Further research is warranted to investigate the reasons why the kinaesthetic sensory mode is a predictor of academic performance and to what extent the VARK mean scores of the four learning preference(s) change with improved English language proficiency.},

This paper proposes a general approach to study that evolution for both atemporal and temporal indicators, based respectively on sequences of static graphs and sequences of time-varying graphs that cover successive time-windows. All the concepts and indicators, some of which are new, are expressed using a time-varying graph formalism.},

Consequently, work on graph-based pattern matching spans a wide range of research communities. Due to variations in graph characteristics and application requirements, graph matching is not a single problem, but a set of related problems. This paper presents a survey of existing work on graph matching, describing variations among problems, general and specific solution approaches, evaluation techniques, and directions for further research. An emphasis is given to techniques that apply to general graphs with semantic characteristics.},

abstract = {We propose Bayesian generative models for unsupervised learning with two types of data and an assumed dependency of one type of data on the other. We consider two algorithmic approaches, based on a correspondence model, where latent variables are shared across datasets. These models indicate the appropriate number of clusters in addition to indicating relevant features in both types of data. We evaluate the model on artificially created data. We then apply the method to a breast cancer dataset consisting of gene expression and microRNA array data derived from the same patients. We assume partial dependence of gene expression on microRNA expression in this study. The method ranks genes within subtypes which have statistically significant abnormal expression and ranks associated abnormally expressing microRNA. We report a genetic signature for the basal-like subtype of breast cancer found across a number of previous gene expression array studies. Using the two algorithmic approaches we find that this signature also arises from clustering on the microRNA expression data and appears derivative from this data.},

@article{Rowe2013,
abstract = {Online communities provide a useful environment for web users to communicate and interact with other users by sharing their thoughts, ideas and opinions, and for resolving problems and issues. Companies and organisations now host online communities in order to support their products and services. Given this investment such communities are required to remain healthy and flourish. The behaviour that users exhibit within online communities is associated with their actions and interactions with other community users while the role that a user assumes is the label associated with a given type of behaviour. The domination of one type of behaviour within an online community can impact upon its health, for example, it might be the case within a question-answering community that there is a large portion of expert users and very few users asking questions, thereby reducing the involvement of and the need for experts. Understanding how the role composition - i.e. the distribution of users assuming different roles -of a community affects its health informs community managers with the early indicators of possible reductions or increases in community activity and how the community is expected to change. In this paper we present an approach to analyse communities based on their role compositions. We present a behaviour ontology that captures user behaviour within a given context (i.e. time period and community) and a semantic-rule based methodology to infer the role that a user has within a community based on his/her exhibited behaviour. We describe a method to tune roles for a given community-platform through the use of statistical clustering and discretisation of continuous feature values. We demonstrate the utility of our approach through role composition analyses of the SAP Community Network by: a) gauging the differences between communities, b) predicting community activity increase/decrease, and c) performing regression analysis of the post count within each community. Our findings indicate that communities on the SAP Community Network differ in terms of their average role percentages and experts, while being similar to one another in terms of the dominant role in each community - being a novice user. The findings also indicate that an increase in expert users who ask questions and initiate discussions was associated with increased community activity and that for 23 of the 25 communities analysed we were able to accurately detect a decrease in community activity using the community’s role composition.},

Our spectral clustering algorithm has a flavor of co-training, which is already a widely used idea in semi-supervised learning. We work on the assumption that the true under- lying clustering would assign a point to the same cluster irrespective of the view. Hence, we constrain our approach to only search for the clusterings that agree across the views. Our algorithm does not have any hyperpa- rameters to set, which is a major advantage in unsupervised learning. We empirically compare with a number of baseline methods on synthetic and real-world datasets to show the efficacy of the proposed algorithm.},

@article{Biddle1986a,
abstract = {Role theory concerns one of the most important features of social life, characteristic behavior patterns or roles. It explains roles by presuming that persons are members of social positions and hold expectations for their own behaviors and those of other persons. Its vocabulary and concerns are popular among social scientists and practitioners, and role concepts have generated a lot of research. At least five perspectives may be discriminated in recent work within the field: functional, symbolic interactionist, structural, organizational, and cognitive role theory. Much of role research reflects practical concerns and derived concepts, and research on four such concepts is reviewed: consensus, conformity, role conflict, and role taking. Recent developments suggest both centrifugal and integrative forces within the role field. The former reflect differing perspectival commitments of scholars, confusions and disagreements over use of role concepts, and the fact that role theory is used to analyze various forms of social system. The latter reflect the shared, basic concerns of the field and efforts by role theorists to seek a broad version of the field that will accommodate a wide range of interests.},

abstract = {Event sequences often contain continuous variability at different levels. In other words, their properties and characteristics change at different rates, concurrently. For example, the sales of a product may slowly become more frequent over a period of several weeks, but there may be interesting variation within a week at the same time. To provide an accurate and robust “view” of such multi-level structural behavior, one needs to determine the appropriate levels of granularity for analyzing the underlying sequence. We introduce the novel problem of finding the best set of window lengths for analyzing discrete event sequences. We define suitable criteria for choosing window lengths and propose an efficient method to solve the problem. We give examples of tasks that demonstrate the applicability of the problem and present extensive experiments on both synthetic data and real data from two domains: text and DNA. We find that the optimal sets of window lengths themselves can provide new insight into the data, e.g., the burstiness of events affects the optimal window lengths for measuring the event frequencies.},

abstract = {In this paper, we study a challenging problem of inferring individuals' role and statuses in a professional social network, which is of central importance in workforce optimization and human capital management. Realizing the natural setting of social nodes associated with dual view information, i.e., The local node characteristics and the global network influence, we present a novel model that explores graph regularization techniques and integrates such information to achieve improved prediction performance. In particular, our prediction model is built upon the graph transductive learning framework that encodes an uncertainty regularization term in the conventional empirical risk minimization principle. Through taking advantage of the information from both the local profile and the global network characteristics, the final inference of the role or statues achieves minimum an empirical loss on the labeled set, as well as a minimum uncertainty on the unlabeled social nodes. We perform extensive empirical study using real-world data and compare with representative peer approaches. The experimental results on three real social network data sets show that the proposed model greatly outperforms a number of baseline models and is able to effectively infer in a wide range of scenarios.},

abstract = {The Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) is frequently used in cluster validation since it is a measure of agreement between two partitions: one given by the clustering process and the other defined by external criteria. In this paper we investigate the usability of this clustering validation measure in supervised classification problems by two different approaches: as a performance measure and in feature selection. Since ARI measures the relation between pairs of dataset elements not using information from classes (labels) it can be used to detect problems with the classification algorithm specially when combined with conventional performance measures. Instead, if we use the class information, we can apply ARI also to perform feature selection. We present the results of several experiments where we have applied ARI both as a performance measure and for feature selection showing the validity of this index for the given tasks.},

abstract = {In a dynamic social or biological environment, interactions between the underlying actors can undergo large and systematic changes. Each actor can assume multiple roles and their degrees of affiliation to these roles can also exhibit rich temporal phenomena. We propose a state space mixed membership stochastic blockmodel which can track across time the evolving roles of the actors. We also derive an efficient variational inference procedure for our model, and apply it to the Enron email networks, and rewiring gene regulatory networks of yeast. In both cases, our model reveals interesting dynamical roles of the actors.},

@article{Casteigts2012,
abstract = {The past few years have seen intensive research efforts carried out in some apparently unrelated areas of dynamic systems -- delay-tolerant networks, opportunistic-mobility networks, social networks -- obtaining closely related insights. Indeed, the concepts discovered in these investigations can be viewed as parts of the same conceptual universe; and the formal models proposed so far to express some specific concepts are components of a larger formal description of this universe. The main contribution of this paper is to integrate the vast collection of concepts, formalisms, and results found in the literature into a unified framework, which we call TVG (for time-varying graphs). Using this framework, it is possible to express directly in the same formalism not only the concepts common to all those different areas, but also those specific to each. Based on this definitional work, employing both existing results and original observations, we present a hierarchical classification of TVGs; each class corresponds to a significant property examined in the distributed computing literature. We then examine how TVGs can be used to study the evolution of network properties, and propose different techniques, depending on whether the indicators for these properties are a-temporal (as in the majority of existing studies) or temporal. Finally, we briefly discuss the introduction of randomness in TVGs.},

abstract = {Online discussion threads are conversational cascades in the form of posted messages that can be generally found in social systems that comprise many-to-many interaction such as blogs, news aggregators or bulletin board systems. We propose a framework based on generative models of growing trees to analyse the structure and evolution of discussion threads. We consider the growth of a discussion to be determined by an interplay between popularity, novelty and a trend (or bias) to reply to the thread originator. The relevance of these features is estimated using a full likelihood approach and allows to characterize the habits and communication patterns of a given platform and/or community.},

We introduce the framework of temporal motifs to study the mesoscale topological-temporal structure of temporal networks in which the events of nodes do not overlap in time. Temporal motifs are classes of similar event sequences, where the similarity refers not only to topology but also to the temporal order of the events. We provide a mapping from event sequences to colored directed graphs that enables an efficient algorithm for identifying temporal motifs. We discuss some aspects of temporal motifs, including causality and null models, and present basic statistics of temporal motifs in a large mobile call network.},

Here a community may be a group of microblogging users who post content on a coherent topic, or who are associated with a specific event or news story. Twitter provides the ability to curate users into lists, corresponding to meaningful topics or themes. Here we describe an approach for crowdsourcing the list building efforts of many different Twitter users, in order to identify topical communities. This approach involves the use of ensemble community finding to produce stable groupings of user lists, and by extension, individual Twitter users. We examine this approach in the context of a case study surrounding the detection of communities on Twitter relating to the London 2012 Olympics.},

abstract = {Recommending products to consumers means not only understanding their tastes, but also understanding their level of experience. For example, it would be a mistake to recommend the iconic ﬁlm Seven Samurai simply because a user enjoys other action movies; rather, we might conclude that they will eventually enjoy it—once they are ready. The same is true for beers, wines, gourmet foods— or any products where users have acquired tastes: the ‘best’ products may not be the most ‘accessible’. Thus our goal in this paper is to recommend products that a user will enjoy now, while acknowledging that their tastes may have changed over time, and may change again in the future. We model how tastes change due to the very act of consuming more products—in other words, as users become more experienced. We develop a latent factor recommendation system that explicitly accounts for each user’s level of experience. We ﬁnd that such a model not only leads to better recommendations, but also allows us to study the role of user experience and expertise on a novel dataset of ﬁfteen million beer, wine, food, and movie reviews},

Analyzing such data with probabilisic models can be delicate because the simple exchangeability assumptions underlying many boilerplate models no longer hold. In this paper, we describe a latent variable model of such data called the mixed membership stochastic blockmodel. This model extends blockmodels for relational data to ones which capture mixed membership latent relational structure, thus providing an object-specific low-dimensional representation. We develop a general variational inference algorithm for fast approximate posterior inference. We explore applications to social and protein interaction networks.},

abstract = {Social roles in online discussion forums can be described by patterned characteristics of communication between network members which we conceive of as ‘structural signatures.' This paper uses visualization methods to reveal these structural signatures and regression analysis to confirm the relationship between these signatures and their associated roles in Usenet newsgroups. Our analysis focuses on distinguishing the signatures of one role from others, the role of “answer people." Answer people are individuals whose dominant behavior is to respond to questions posed by other users. We found that answer people predominantly contribute one or a few messages to discussions initiated by others, are disproportionately tied to relative isolates, have few intense ties and have few triangles in their local networks. OLS regression shows that these signatures are strongly correlated with role behavior and, in combination, provide a strongly predictive model for identifying role behavior (R =.72). To conclude, we consider strategies for further improving the identification of role behavior in online discussion settings and consider how the development of a taxonomy of author types could be extended to a taxonomy of newsgroups in particular and discussion systems in general. 2},

As an example, in networks of communication via email, text messages, or phone calls, edges represent sequences of instantaneous or practically instantaneous contacts. In some cases, edges are active for non-negligible periods of time: e.g., the proximity patterns of inpatients at hospitals can be represented by a graph where an edge between two individuals is on throughout the time they are at the same ward. Like network topology, the temporal structure of edge activations can affect dynamics of systems interacting through the network, from disease contagion on the network of patients to information diffusion over an e-mail network. In this review, we present the emergent field of temporal networks, and discuss methods for analyzing topological and temporal structure and models for elucidating their relation to the behavior of dynamical systems. In the light of traditional network theory, one can see this framework as moving the information of when things happen from the dynamical system on the network, to the network itself. Since fundamental properties, such as the transitivity of edges, do not necessarily hold in temporal networks, many of these methods need to be quite different from those for static networks.},

abstract = {Discussion boards are a form of social media which allow users to discuss topics and exchange information in a complex manner, in a number of different settings. As the popularity of such message boards has increased, communities of users have emerged, and several prominent types of social role have been identified, such as Question Answerer, Celebrity, Discussion Person and Topic Initiator. Recent studies have noted the structural similarity of the egocentric network of users assigned the same role by qualitative criteria. In this paper a methodology is developed with which to cluster together users with similar ego-centric network structures. This is achieved using a mixed membership formulation which allows for the fact that different groups of users may have characteristics in common. The method is then applied to data taken from boards.ie, a medium sized message boards website. Prominent clusters of users are identified and discussed, and illustrative examples of user behaviour provided. The type of interaction, both locally and globally, taking place within forums is examined.},

In this article, we show that the seemingly innocuous combination of knowledge of confirmed contacts between members on the one hand and their email contacts to non-members on the other hand provides enough information to deduce a substantial proportion of relationships between non-members. Using machine learning we achieve an area under the (receiver operating characteristic) curve (AUC) of at least 0.85 for predicting whether two non-members known by the same member are connected or not, even for conservative estimates of the overall proportion of members, and the proportion of members disclosing their contacts.},

abstract = {There is overwhelming evidence for regional variation across the United States on a range of key political, economic, social, and health indicators. However, a substantial body of research suggests that activities in each of these domains are typically influenced by psychological variables, raising the possibility that psychological forces might be the mediating or causal factors responsible for regional variation in the key indicators. Thus, the present article examined whether configurations of psychological variables, in this case personality traits, can usefully be used to segment the country. Do regions emerge that can be defined in terms of their characteristic personality profiles? How are those regions distributed geographically? And are they associated with particular patterns of key political, economic, social, and health indicators? Results from cluster analyses of 5 independent samples totaling over 1.5 million individuals identified 3 robust psychological profiles: Friendly \& Conventional, Relaxed \& Creative, and Temperamental \& Uninhibited. The psychological profiles were found to cluster geographically and displayed unique patterns of associations with key geographical indicators. The findings demonstrate the value of a geographical perspective in unpacking the connections between microlevel processes and consequential macrolevel outcomes.},

We present the Author-Recipient-Topic (ART) model for social network analysis, which learns topic distributions based on the direction-sensitive messages sent between entities. The model builds on Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and the Author-Topic (AT) model, adding the key attribute that distribution over topics is conditioned distinctly on both the sender and recipient--steering the discovery of topics according to the relationships between people. We give results on both the Enron email corpus and a researcher's email archive, providing evidence not only that clearly relevant topics are discovered, but that the ART model better predicts people's roles and gives lower perplexity on previously unseen messages. We also present the Role-Author-Recipient-Topic (RART) model, an extension to ART that explicitly represents people's roles.},

By predicting popular posts on the Social Web, that contain lengthy discussions and debates, analysts can focus their attention more effectively on content that is deemed more influential. In this paper we present a two-step approach to anticipate discussions in community forums by a) identifying seed posts - i.e., posts that generate discussions, and b) predicting the length of these discussions. We explore the effectiveness of a range of features in anticipating discussions such as user and content features, and present 'focus' features that capture the topical concentration of a user. For identifying seed posts we show that content features are better predictors than user features, while achieving an F1 value of 0.792 when using all features. For predicting discussion activity we find a positive correlation between the focus of the user and discussion volumes, and achieve an nDCG@1 value of 0.89 when predicting using user features.},

Tools such as social networks analysis and text mining have contributed to their understanding in order to develop counter-terrorism applications. This work addresses the topic-based community key-members extraction problem, for which our method combines both text mining and social network analysis techniques. This is achieved by first applying latent Dirichlet allocation to build two topic-based social networks in online forums: one social network oriented towards the thread creator point-of-view, and the other is oriented towards the repliers of the overall forum. Then, by using different network analysis measures, topic-based key members are evaluated using as benchmark a social network built a plain representation of the network of posts. Experiments were successfully performed using an English language based forum available in the Dark Web portal.},

abstract = {Each relationship has its own personality. Almost immediately after a social interaction begins, verbal and nonverbal behaviors become synchronized. Even in asocial contexts, individuals tend to produce utterances that match the grammatical structure of sentences they have recently heard or read. Three projects explore language style matching (LSM) in everyday writing tasks and professional writing. LSM is the relative use of 9 function word categories (e.g., articles, personal pronouns) between any 2 texts. In the first project, 2 samples totaling 1,744 college students answered 4 essay questions written in very different styles. Students automatically matched the language style of the target questions. Overall, the LSM metric was internally consistent and reliable across writing tasks. Women, participants of higher socioeconomic status, and students who earned higher test grades matched with targets more than others did. In the second project, 74 participants completed cliffhanger excerpts from popular fiction. Judges' ratings of excerpt-response similarity were related to content matching but not function word matching, as indexed by LSM. Further, participants were not able to intentionally increase style or content matching. In the final project, an archival study tracked the professional writing and personal correspondence of 3 pairs of famous writers across their relationships. Language matching in poetry and letters reflected fluctuations in the relationships of 3 couples: Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung, Elizabeth Barrett and Robert Browning, and Sylvia Plath and Ted Hughes. Implications for using LSM as an implicit marker of social engagement and influence are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2010 APA, all rights reserved).},

abstract = {Understanding social interaction within groups is key to analyzing online communities. Most current work focuses on structural properties: who talks to whom, and how such interactions form larger network structures. The interactions themselves, however, generally take place in the form of natural language --- either spoken or written --- and one could reasonably suppose that signals manifested in language might also provide information about roles, status, and other aspects of the group's dynamics. To date, however, finding such domain-independent language-based signals has been a challenge. Here, we show that in group discussions power differentials between participants are subtly revealed by how much one individual immediately echoes the linguistic style of the person they are responding to. Starting from this observation, we propose an analysis framework based on linguistic coordination that can be used to shed light on power relationships and that works consistently across multiple types of power --- including a more "static" form of power based on status differences, and a more "situational" form of power in which one individual experiences a type of dependence on another. Using this framework, we study how conversational behavior can reveal power relationships in two very different settings: discussions among Wikipedians and arguments before the U.S. Supreme Court.},

This book examines the advantages as well as the shortcomings of the role stance.Organized into nine chapters, this book begins with an overview of behaviors that are characteristics of persons within contexts and the various processes that are employed to explain and predict those behaviors. This text then examines the concepts of the role field and discovers their applications to social problems of pressing concern. Other chapters consider the empirical evidence that has been developed within the role orientation concerning social problems. This book discusses as well the behavioral comparability, behavior linkage, behavioral effects, and complex linking concepts for behaviors. The final chapter discusses how contexts may affect the behaviors of persons and how those behaviors may have subsequent functions.This book is a valuable resource for anthropologists, sociologists, and social psychologists.},
