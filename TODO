TODO:
====

* Variance of intercept should be infered so that it learns to me more or less dogmatic.


BUGS:
====

  * [1] Error in S_ar_[, , z] : subscript out of bounds
    * Fix:  z_init cannot have gaps in the labels.

  * [2] sample_b(). Lambda_post sometimes computationally singular
    * Fix: add tryCatch and call use MASS::ginv() for those cases

  * [3] sample_beta_a0() -> ars2.beta() -> beta.f_y(): 
           Still some "Error in S[, , r] : subscript out of bounds"
    * Fix: R <- dim(S)[1]  fixed to R <- dim(S)[3] (check python implementation too!)

  * [4] sample_beta_a0() -> ars2.beta()
    Error: Trap in ARS: Maximum number of attempts reached by routine spl1_
	In addition: Warning message:
	value out of range in 'lgamma' 
    * Fix 1: tryCatch and use W=signif(W,1) if exception

  * [5]
