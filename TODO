BUGS:
====

  * [1] Error in S_ar_[, , z] : subscript out of bounds
    * Fix:  z_init cannot have gaps in the labels.

  * [2] sample_b(). Lambda_post sometimes computationally singular
    * Fix: add tryCatch and call use MASS::ginv() for those cases

  * [3] sample_beta_a0() -> ars2.beta() -> beta.f_y(): 
           Still some "Error in S[, , r] : subscript out of bounds"
    * Fix: R <- dim(S)[1]  fixed to R <- dim(S)[3] (check python implementation too!)

  * [4] sample_beta_a0() -> ars2.beta()
    Error: Trap in ARS: Maximum number of attempts reached by routine spl1_
	In addition: Warning message:
	value out of range in 'lgamma' 
    * Fix 1: tryCatch and use W=signif(W,1) if exception

   * [6]: Intercept does not move (sometimes).
	Fix: do not use W_b0 and mu_b0 since they are sampled given the coefficients and we want the intercept to be independent.
   
  * [7] Error in unserialize(node$con) : error reading from connection
	Calls: <Anonymous> ... doTryCatch -> recvData -> recvData.SOCKnode -> unserialize
	In addition: Warning message:
	In file(filename, "r", encoding = encoding) :
	  cannot open file 'gibbs_dual.r': No such file or directory
	Execution halted

	Fix? memory issues? should
CHANGES
=======

   * Intercept is given its own prior independent of the rest of coefficients. Otherwise it will behave badly if coefficients have extremely low variance.
   * Tried to re-use b in case of exeption, but doesn't fix anything.
   * W_b0  fixed to 1 to avoid coupling during the MCMC where it tends to 0 while s_br goes to inf and coeffs in every cluster are more and more similar.
