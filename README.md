Dual DP-GMM
=====

  * DP-GMM: default
  * fixed-GMM: set alpha=0 and dont sample it
  * single: use sample_z() and do not sample feature view


Multi DP-GMM is a double dirichlet process that simultaneously does:

 * Cluster users with respect to their attributes.
 * Cluster users with respect to their behaviors.
 
Inference is done with Monte Carlo methods: Gibbs Sampling and Adaptive Rejection Sampling.
